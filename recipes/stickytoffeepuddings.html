    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sticky toffee puddings made in little moulds with no steaming, no caramel to make,

        <li>½ tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>50g/2oz butter, softened, plus extra for greasing the moulds</li>
        <li>175g/6oz dark muscovado sugar</li>
        <li>1½ tsp golden syrup</li>
        <li>1½ tsp black treacle</li>
        <li>200g/7oz self-raising flour</li>
        <li>2 free-range eggs</li>
        <li>1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
        <li>500ml/18fl oz double cream</li>
        <li>175g/6oz demerara sugar</li>
        <li>175g/6oz butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp golden syrup</li>
        <li>1 tbsp black treacle</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.</li>
        <li>Butter eight small pudding basins (dariole moulds) and sprinkle demerara sugar inside, coating evenly. Shake any excess sugar out of the moulds, and place them on a baking tray.</li>
        <li>Place the dates with 250ml/9fl oz water into a saucepan and bring up to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2-3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.</li>
        <li>Stir the vanilla extract into the date mixture.</li>
        <li>Blend with a stick blender until the date mixture is thick and soupy.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the butter and muscovado sugar together until smooth.</li>
        <li>Stir in the syrup and treacle, then the flour, mixing well.</li>
        <li>Break the eggs one at a time into the bowl, stirring well after each one.</li>
        <li>Add the bicarbonate of soda to the date mixture, then pour into the flour mixture and beat well to blend.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared pudding basins, filling them two-thirds full.</li>
        <li>Put the puddings into the oven immediately, and bake for 20 minutes until well-risen and springy to the touch.</li>
        <li>For the sauce, gently heat the cream in a saucepan. Add the sugar and butter and whisk until melted. Whisk in the syrup and treacle.</li>
        <li>To serve, turn the pudding out onto a plate, spoon the sauce over the top and around, then finish with a dollop of ice cream.</li>
    </ol>
