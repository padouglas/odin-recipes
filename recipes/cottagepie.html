        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            James Martin's easy cottage pie recipe is a family favourite. He goes back to basics to show you how to make
            a
            classic version, but easier.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 large onion or 3–4 banana shallots, finely chopped</li>
        <li>650g/1lb 7oz beef mince</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
        <li>1 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>150ml/5fl oz red wine</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only</li>
        <li>400ml/14fl oz beef stock</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce, to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>50ml/2fl oz olive oil</li>
        <li>900g/2lb King Edward potatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>115g/4oz butter</li>
        <li>125ml/4½fl oz milk</li>
        <li>150g/5½oz frozen peas</li>
        <li>50g/1¾oz butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat half the oil in a large heavy-based pan. Add the onion and cook until softened. Tip it onto a plate.
        </li>
        <li>Return the pan to the heat and add the remaining oil. When it's hot, fry the mince, in batches if needed,
            for 4–5 minutes, or until browned all over.</li>
        <li>Stir in the cooked onion and tomato purée and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the flour and cook for a further
            minute. Pour in the red wine, scraping up any caramelised bits with a wooden spoon, and add the thyme.</li>
        <li>Add the stock and simmer for 45 minutes, or until the mince is tender and the mixture has thickened. Season
            to taste, and add a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Keep warm over a very low heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, for the mash, put the potatoes in a pan of salted water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat
            and simmer for 12–15 minutes, or until they are tender.</li>
        <li>Drain and return the potatoes to the pan, then place over the heat for about 1 minute to drive off any
            excess moisture. Mash well, then add the butter and milk, beating to form a smooth mash. Season to taste.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to high. Put the cottage pie filling in a baking dish and spoon the mash over the top.
            Grill for 8–10 minutes, or until golden-brown.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, boil the peas in boiling water in a small saucepan for 3–4 minutes, then drain and add the
            butter. Serve the cottage pie with the peas.</li>
    </ol>
